## Introduction
In this paper we studied the relationship between sentiment expressed on Twitter from financial accounts [9] and the two financial indices SPX and VIX. The SPX is an index that tracks the composite price movement of the S&P 500.  We grouped our data by datetime using different resolutions and taking the average sentiment within the time period and percent change of price between latest data points of consecutive intervals for financial indices. We also looked at the correlations when offsetting financial and Twitter data by datetime. We found a small positive correlation between sentiment and VIX price movement when using a resolution of 360 minutes and an offset of 1800 minutes. This correlation was derived using Pearsonâ€™s method and was deemed statistically significant with a confidence interval of 95%.
